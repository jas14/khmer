# khmer v1.2 release notes

This is the v1.2 release of khmer: minor new features and bug fixes. The start
of this release cycle coincided with the Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint
2014. We honor and thank the 19 new contributors (including four Michigan State
University undergraduates) who volunteered their time to contribute!

## Known issues:

All of these are pre-existing.

Multithreaded reading will drop reads. This major issue has been present for
several khmer releases and was only found via a much larger test case that we
had been previously using. Credit to @camillescott. Workaround: disable
threading. The next release will fix this and the other FAST[AQ] parsing
issues. https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/681

Some users have reported that normalize-by-median.py will utilize more
memory than it was configured for. This is being investigated in
https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/266

Some FASTQ files confuse our parser when running with more than one thread.
For example, while using load-into-counting.py. If you experience this then
add "--threads=1" to your command line. This issue is being tracked in
https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/249

If your k-mer table is truncated on write, an error may not be reported; this
is being tracked in https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/443.
However, khmer will now (correctly) fail when trying to read a truncated file
(See #333).

Paired-end reads from Casava 1.8 currently require renaming for use in
normalize-by-median and abund-filter when used in paired mode. The
integration of a fix for this is being tracked in
https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/23

Some scripts only output FASTA even if given a FASTQ file. This issue
is being tracked in https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/46

A user reported that abundance-dist-single.py fails with small files and many
threads. This issue is being tracked in
https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/75
